# Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler

Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story 
* AS AN employee with a busy schedule 
* I WANT to add important events to a daily planner 
* SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria 
* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule 
* WHEN I open the planner 
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar 
* WHEN I scroll down 
* THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours 
* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day 
* THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future 
* WHEN I click into a time block 
* THEN I can enter an event 
* WHEN I click the save button for that time block 
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage 
* WHEN I refresh the page 
* THEN the saved events persist
